### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer currently working on a web app that helps users manage parking properties.

Tech Stack:
- **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for the frontend
- **Supabase** for database and authentication

I'm passionate about building practical tools and learning modern web technologies. Stay tuned for updates as I build and improve this project!

Let's connect and collaborate!
